This project involved the development of a haircut booking website for both barbers and customers, with a
focus on security and verification. It allowed users to post their shops, upload pictures, specify opening hours
and prices, and manage bookings. Customers could use geolocation to search, leave reviews, book
appointments, and manage their appointments. SMS and email verification were implemented for user
registration and booking notifications
